# Exercism-matrix-solution-2
Tried figuring out how to do this problem, I needed to look up the map method to understand how to approach this exercise. Will continue to read and try to solve the columns tests.
Needed to look up more examples on this solution to see how it's approached/what options there are with mapping.
